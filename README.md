I'm Alex C-G - I'm the Developer Relations Lead at [Jina AI](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/). This is my personal README - it's here to give you a quick overview of who I am and how best to get my attention.

Most of the projects in my profile are written in Python, though I also muck around with Arduino and have the usual smattering of shell scripts, Markdown and whatnot.
