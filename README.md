I'm a tech content editor at [Jina AI](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/). I've worked in open source for most of my career, in fields as diverse as sustainable construction and aerospace, and I make animatronic butterflies in my spare time. At work I'm an old-school curmudgeon, happy living in the shell and vim, and avoiding those new-fangled mice and GUIs. My languages of choice are Python, Arduino, and angry swearing at misbehaving machines.

If you want to speak to me, the best way to reach out is [Mastodon](https://chaos.social/@alexcg).
