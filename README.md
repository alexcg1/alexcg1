Alex C-G is the Developer Relations Lead at [Jina AI](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/), responsible for building Jina's userbase and making onboarding buttery smooth. He's worked in open source for most of his career, in fields as diverse as sustainable construction and aerospace, and makes animatronic butterflies in his spare time. At work he is an old-school curmudgeon, happy living in the shell and vim, and avoiding those new-fangled mice and GUIs. Alex's languages of choice are Python, Arduino, and angry swearing at misbehaving machines.
